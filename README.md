CalcX-11 : A Midweight and Powerful Calculator. Made with WinAppSDK!

Heron's Formula, Compound Interest, etc., many things we learn, but overtime it becomes boring.
Asking ChatGPT? Or using an online solver? Well, why not do it offline?
Presenting CalcX-11! Made by only 1 person and AI, with all of us in mind! 
It's not revolutionary, but it's helpful! Considering you don't need prompting anymore! Also it will be my nicest GUI App EVER!

And what's more? It's coming soon! Here's a prototype of the app (It's not final).
